# Using Convolutional Neural Netwok 
This repo is to practice deep learning on images. 
The goal is to learn the image classification, transfer learning, class activation maps, 
evaluation and fine tuning of the model and many more which will be added.

- The Initial_CNN folder contains my first ever CNN network.
- The Improved_Model contains a better approch from data preprocessing to the model itself to the evaluation model.
